Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that targets T helper cells, also known as CD4 cells, which are specific immune system cells when it infects a person. The virus multiplies and gradually destroys the cells that it calls home, weakening the body's defenses against infections 
Sexual contact with injectable drugs, sharing needles among injectees, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) through breast milk or before or during delivery are the main ways that HIV is spread. 
HIV infection is a widespread, sexually transmitted illness that affects all ages and genders in Kenya. It is mostly driven by sexual activity. There were 660,000 children listed as AIDS orphans as of 2015. Nonetheless, members of important communities have an abnormally high rate of new infections. According to estimates from 2020, these groups account for 30% of all new HIV infections in Kenya each year.
